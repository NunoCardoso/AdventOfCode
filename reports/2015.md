# Day 1: Not Quite Lisp

> Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor.
> The directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then 
> follows the instructions one character at a time.

Functional puzzle. While parsing input, split into characters, and keep the counting.

# Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

> The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. 
> They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want
> to order exactly as much as they need.

Functional puzzle. While parsing input, I will do basic math sums.

# Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum

> Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.
> He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the 
> North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next.

Good solution in the sense that a set is passed as function arg and changed by reference. 
It makes an elegant code solution. 

While I am parsing the input, I am updating the locations and placing them on a Set, which stores
unique values. I serialize the locations as strings.

# Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

> Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

Nothing I can do to make it faster, I have to generate MD5 hashes in succession 
until they meet the puzzle criteria.

All puzzles tagged as MD5 will not meet the less-than-1-second criteria.

# Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

> Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

While parsing input, do text regex checking and conut which ones satisfy the puzzle criteria

# Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

> Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after year, 
> you've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid.

I am plotting the data on a 2D grid, performing changes until end state is reached.

# Day 7: Some Assembly Required

> This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby 
> is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.

This is the first recursive puzzle, works as intended.

The recursive function "leafs" return number or an operation with numbers. When there is a string involved, 
the function is called again until it is resolved as a number.

# Day 8: Matchsticks

> Space on the sleigh is limited this year, and so Santa will be bringing his list as a digital copy.
> He needs to know how much space it will take up when stored.

Using JSON.stringify helps a lot in the parsing step, so Typescript is an advantage.

# Day 9: All in a Single Night

> Every year, Santa manages to deliver all of his presents in a single night.
> This year, however, he has some new locations to visit; his elves have provided him 
> the distances between every pair of locations.

This is a city path travelling problem, finding the shortest / longest routes.

With this amount of cities, it is manageable to visit all permutations. Maybe for more cities, 
some sort of optimization / path finding could work faster.

# Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say

> Today, the Elves are playing a game called look-and-say. 
> They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. 
> For example, 211 is read as "one two, two ones", which becomes 1221 (1 2, 2 1s).

This is the look-and-say sequence. It can be done with regex in 1.5s (medium speed). 
Making the whole string and process it each iteration, will get slower with each iteration.
On 100 iterations, this will be noticeable, so we need a more scalable solution.

To be faster, we need to look at patterns that should be easy to predict how they will branch out.

According to the [Cosmological theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CosmologicalTheorem.html), 
this is a well known problem.

input `1113122113` is the 6th iteration on the list that starts with 3 ([Here is the full list](https://oeis.org/A022471)).

We can [use a list of the evolutions](https://njohnston.ca/2010/10/a-derivation-of-conways-degree-71-look-and-say-polynomial/) 
and compute it without the need for regexes.

# Day 11: Corporate Policy

> Santa's previous password expired, and he needs help choosing a new one.

Let's keep generating passwords until it matches the criteria, not much optimization can be done here,
as the generation always depends on the previous step, unless we make some convoluted pattern-prediction 
algorithm, only to bypass brute-force.

Note that using 

    !!password.match(/(abc|bcd|cde|def|efg|fgh|ghi|hij|ijk|jkl|lkm|kmn|mno|nop|opq|pqr|qrs|rst|stu|tuv|uvw|vwx|wxy|xyz)/)

is slower than iterating the password characters and detecting the number sequence.

Not happy with the code for portion calculation, but it works. 
The portion calculation code slices a 100 unit into 5 pieces with all length combinations,
and as such we brute-force the solution. Maybe a path finding solution would work.

Tried a path finding approach and failed. There are many pitfalls and holes. It probably can be done, 
but this is a way more efficient solution, and the one which is probably the intended one, looking 
at the way the reactions and the molecules from input were defined.

there are three types of reactions:
 
* first type
   
 `e => B C` or `A => B C`

* second type
    `A => B Rn C Ar`, represented as `A => B ( C )`

* third type

    `A => B Rn C Y D Ar`, represented as `A => B ( C , D )`

    `A => B Rn C Y D Y E Ar`, represented as `A => B ( C , D, E )`

## First type

This reaction gets two atoms/molecules from one atom/molecule, except the ones with `Rn`, `Y` and `Ar`.

For reactions like `ABC => DE => F`, we get 2 steps from 3 atoms, 10 steps from 11 atoms, etc.

Therefore, the formula is:

     steps = count(atoms) - 1

## Second type

The `A => B ( C )` reactions are kind of the same as `A => B C`, in the sense that ( and ) do not add a step count.

So, `A(B(C(D(E)))) => ABCDE` (or `ABCDE => A(B(C(D(E))))`), we will have the same formula:

     steps = count(atoms) - 1

Note that a match of `Rn` or `Ar` atoms does not affect step count.
  
## Third type

The `X => B Rn C Y D Ar` ( or `X => B ( C , D )` ) reaction uses one step.

    A(B(C(D,E),F),G) => A(B(X,F),G) => A(Y, G) => Z

As in, `atoms - commas - 1` yields 3 steps

The `X => B Rn C Y D Y E Ar` ( `X => B ( C, D, E )` ) reaction uses one step.

    A(B(C(D,E,F),G,H),I,J) => A(B(X,G,H),I,J) => A(Y,I,J) => Z

3 steps, as in `atoms - commas - 1`  => 10 - 6 - 1 => 3 steps

We can just count atoms and commas, where atoms is everything except `Rn` and `Ar`, 
and commas are `Y`

    A(B(C(D,E(F,G),K),L(M,N),O),P) =>
    A(B(C(D,E(F,G),K),\1,O),P) =>
    A(B(C(D,\2,K),\1,O),P) =>
    A(B(\3,\1,O),P) =>
    A(\4,P) =>
    \5

So, 5 steps that can be calculated by 13 atoms and 7 commas (13 - 7 - 1)

# Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses

> To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door. 
> He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

The bruteforce method does it in 1.7s. It is not a perfect bruteforce, as it iterates houses 
and then calculates the presents.

A much better option is to fill out the house space and iterate each elf. This way we do not have 
to find divisors repeatedly, just use each elf distance and iterate. 

Then, we can just find the first house that overshoots the threashold. The top house limit is set to the 
threshold.

This is known as the [highly abundant numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_abundant_number), and they 
are really hard to work with it. There is not really formulas to help us to predict / estimate something
so we can jump / optimize, so we are sticking with above approach that is brute-force-ish

Really fun puzzle to implement. A little hard to get the day sequence right, 
but surprisingly quick to get optimal solution. 

Another note, see that I added None as entries, so we can have a seamless way of checking if 
a setup with partial gear solves the puzzle. 

As there is not many combinations, a brute force approach is OK, runs really quick.

Note: I simplified greatly the hero/boss structure so I could ditch global.structuredClone and use spread operator. 
This made my code go from 1 second to 0.6 seconds. global.structuredClone is slow.

# Day 23: Opening the Turing Lock

> Little Jane Marie just got her very first computer for Christmas from some unknown benefactor. 
> It comes with instructions and an example program, but the computer itself seems to be malfunctioning. 
> She's curious what the program does, and would like you to help her run it.

Another instruction list puzzle, not requiring anything special, just follow the program and output the final state.

# Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

> It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's deliveries.
> However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics,
> and nobody gets presents this year.

The problem with this puzzle, is that a generic solution can be done, but it will take 
several seconds. So, in order to run under 1s, we need to fit to the problem here. 

First optimization is to iterate from the first number of packages that can match or exceed the 
targeted weight. It shaves some unnecessary combinations from lengths that would never produce 
anything useful 

        let minPackages = 0, sum = 0
        while (sum < targetWeight) sum += packages[minPackages++]

The optimization here is that we do not recursively try to check if the other compartments can fit 
packages with targeted weight. For 3 compartments, finding one is enough, as the remaining ones can fit in halves.
For 4 compartments, one should check if the remaining packages fit in 3 compartments. 

Well, I skipped this step as it looks like finding the minimal quantum entanglement for one compartment 
is enough. Still, this runs at > 6 seconds, which no clue on how I can speed up the combination process.
