# Day 3: Spiral Memory

> Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and 
> then counting up while spiraling outward.

Tried to be smart and avoid doing a spiral for part 1, but part 2 "forces" me to do a spiral anyway...

Since both parts do not share code or states, I wrap them in different functions to be easier to follow.

## Logic for part 1

For part 1, I can see a pattern on the lower right corner: 

    17  16  15  14  13
    18   5   4   3  12
    19   6   1   2  11
    20   7   8   9  10
    21  22  23  24  25

lowerRightCorner is `(radius * 2 - 1) * (radius * 2 - 1)`. Radius is 3, gives 25 
(note that Radius 1 gives the number 1).  

This helps in knowing the radius that will have the number from puzzle input. 
The outer square is 4 sides of `2 * (radius - 1)`. For a radius of 3, side size is 4.

Then, I will go back on side at a time, until the puzzle value is contained in it. 
For example, if the puzzle value is 20, then I will go back to the side with 21,20,19,18. 

Then, I calculate `distanceToCenterOfSquareSide` with:
    
     distanceToCenterOfSquareSide = Math.abs(previousCorner + (radius - 1) - puzzleValue)

As in, `Math.abs(17 + (3 - 1) - 20) = -1`. There is a distance of 1 from number 20 to the center 
of that side, given by number 19.

The Manhattan distance is simply `radius - 1` for the horizontal distance, `distanceToCenterOfSquareSide` for the vertical distance.

## Logic for part 2 

Just calculate and see when it meets the threshold.

We will use the x/y coordinates as normal charts do, x getting positive going right, y getting positive going up. 

If I am going to represent the center of these hexagonals in x/y axis, then the hexagon can have a height of 2,

To go from `[7.5,5]` to `[0,0]`, it takes 5 steps. Easily tracked with the Y value. 
Now, note that to go from `[7.5,5]` to `[0,4]`, it also takes the same 5 steps.

one can do, to calculate distances quickly, is to: 
- check which quadrant we are (x/y positive or not)
- for each quadrant, walk in [1,5, 1] bits until hitting an axis (x or y)
- if it hits y axis, the remainer steps are just y values / 2.
- if it hits x axis, the remainer steps are y values until it hits, plus remainer divided by 1.5.

Example 1: hexagon at `12,4`. Quadrant NE. Bits of  [-1,5, -1].

On axis X, 12 will go to 0 in 6 bits (`Math.abs(12 / -1,5)`). 
On axis Y, 4 will go to 0 in 4 bits (`Math.abs(4 / -1)`)

It hits the X axis first with 4 moves which brings us to [6,0]. 
Then, since X still has to go, it is 6 / 1.5 = 4 more moves, for a total of 8 moves.

Example 2: hexagon at `3,6`. Quadrant NE. Bits of  [-1,5, -1].

On axis X, 3 will go to 0 in 2 bits (`Math.abs(3 / -1,5)`).
On axis Y, 6 will go to 0 in 6 bits (`Math.abs(6 / -1)`)

It hits the Y axis first with 2 moves which brings us to [0,4]
Then, since Y still has to go, it is 4 / 2 = 2 more moves, for a total of 4 moves.

Bruteforce takes 30 seconds on part1, so it's time for optimizations.

## Optimization 1: Bitwises

One optimization is that comparing if two numbers share the last 16 bits, 
it is easier to compare their division remainders over 65536 (2^16), because 
that is exactly what those numbers are. 

That lowers it to 15 seconds. Still, since the modulo is a 2 power number,
we can use a bitwise operator, as in

       (number1 & 0xFFFF)
       (number1 % 2**16)

produces the same result: get the rightmost 4 hexadecimal numbers (or 16 binary numbers) 

This reduces 5 more seconds to 10 seconds.

For generation 2, on checking if it is multiple of 4 or 8, I can use same bitwise operator, as
`% 8` is the same as `& 7`, and `% 4` is the same as `& 3`.

## Optimization 2: Bigints

Also, if I use bigints 
  
    const mod2147483647 = (x: bigint): number => Number(x % 2147483647n)

Code runs in 3.5 seconds. It runs in 5 seconds if I use normal numbers.

If I use exclusively bigints and bitwise operators, it reduces to 1.6 seconds!

## Optimization 3: Reimplement modulo

The remainder is 2147483647, which is a Marsenne prime, or 2^32 - 1, or 0x7FFFFFFF

JavaScript numbers operate on 32 bits, so a modulo over 2147483647 can't be done on bitwise, 
there is not enough bits.

The solution is to split the [big numbers that will be moduloded into bits](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/cv24nt/2017_day_15_implementing_a_fast_modulo_algorithm/), 
and do bitwise operations on the chunks.

    const generate = (n: number, m: number) => {
    let a = (n >> 16) * m; // 15 + 16 bits
    let b = ((n >> 8) & 0xff) * m; // 8 + 16 bits
    let c = (n & 0xff) * m; // 8 + 16 bits

        b += c >> 8;
        c &= 0xff;
        a += b >> 8;
        b &= 0xff;
        c += a >> 15;
        a &= 0x7fff;
    
        b += c >> 8;
        c &= 0xff;
        a += b >> 8;
        b &= 0xff;
        c += a >> 15;
        a &= 0x7fff;
    
        return (a << 16) + (b << 8) + c;
    };

We receive a 31 bits number `n` and a 16 bits multiplier `m`. 
The `n` is first split into three separate smaller chunks with bitwise operators, 
before they're all multiplied by `m`.

Same logic as `1234 * 1000` can be split into `1200 * 1000 + 34 * 1000`, but in binary.
Note that >> "cleans" bits to the right, & 0xFF "cleans" bits to the left. 

The maximum size of a chunk (before multiplication) is 15 bits, 
that totals to 31 bits after multiplication; the maximum that JS can handle unsigned.

Next we apply some carry-overs. Our `c` chunk got the smallest of the input bits and is intended as 8 bits.
but after the multiplication it's up to 24 bits. So we take the 16 high bits and carry them over to chunk `b`. 

Similarly we carry-over from `b` to `a`, *and* from `a` back to `c`. This last step completes the cycle, 
and is where the fast modulo algorithm comes into play. It essentially applies this operation: 

    x = (x >> 31) + (x & 0x7fffffff)

the only difference is that our number is split into three chunks. Just like the original fast modulo algorithm, 
we need to run this twice as well.

Finally, we recombine our three chunks and return.

Difficulty: Very hard to optimize under 1 second.

# Day 16: Permutation Promenade 

> You come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to be dancing.

This is a typical have-to-find-a-delta so I can skip 10000000 iterations.

What we tried to do with puzzle 15, but couldn't find a pattern. 

So, the idea is that the program generators will end up in a repeated loop. With that, we can 
skip right to the end, so we do not have to repeat generations. 

So, if we see the same pattern at position 50 and then at position 150, that means that 
at position 250, 350, etc we will get the same values. In other words, the delta is 100, and the 
constant is 50. This ay, when we need to know the value at any number, let's say 499990, then it's about 
knowing what is the closest number without exceeding it. 

In this case:

     50 + 100 * x < 499990
     x < (500000 - 50) / 100
     x < 4999,4

So, using 50 + 100 * 4999 gives 499950, and we know that the values generated on 
iteration 499990 is the same as iteration 50, so for iteration 499990, just add 40 more, so it is 50 + 40.
We can use the value found at iteration 90 to get the value at iteration 499990.
