# Day 1: Sonar Sweep

# Day 7: The Treachery of Whale

> A giant whale has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!
> Suddenly, a swarm of crabs (each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms in to 
> rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean floor; sensors indicate a massive 
> underground cave system just beyond where they're aiming!

Brute force works ok, calculating distances for each position.

Note that one great optimization done is to avoid calculating double for crabs in same positions. 
I just keep track of how many crabs are in the same position, and multiply fuel consumption accordingly with 
the number of crabs, so I only have to do one calculation.

No performance improvements using Record instead of Map. 

On part 2, the fuel consumption 'accelerates' from each step. 

So, going from position 16 to 5, it uses 66 fuel: 

| position | fuel | total |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 15       | 1   | 1     |
| 14       | 2   | 3     |
| 13       | 3   | 6     |
| 12       | 4   | 10    |
| 11       | 5   | 15    |
| 10       | 6   | 21    |
| 9        | 7   | 28    |
| 8        | 8   | 36    |
| 7        | 9   | 45    |
| 6        | 10  | 55    |
| 5        | 11  | 66    |

Or the formula: 

    (distance + ((distance - 1) * (distance - 1) + (distance - 1)) / 2)
    11 + ((10*10) + 10)/2 = 66

A little tricky to get the function to filter out invalid paths. 

This is a breadth-first path finding, as we want all combinations, and we can widen them all until the end.

Note that going back to visited places is allowed.

A little hard to get the functions that do the folding, specially when there are folds that overlap the 
other side and doublefold. Once that is figured out, just clean out duplicate points and redo.

One can see that in progress: 

    Template:     NNCB
    After step 1: NCNBCHB
    After step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
    After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB
    After step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB

A seed of 4 sizes becomes 7 (enlarged by 4 - 1). Then, 7 becomes 13 (7 + 7 - 1). And so on.
The edges are constant. In the first seed, they are N and B, and will still be there.
So, we can have the polymer to be in a map where pairs of letters are keys. 

This of course assumes that there will be aleways a rule that will react to any pair. 
By using the map, we do not need to repeat the operations, just multiply by numbers.

First approach takes 2.7 seconds

It was hard to get the recursion right. Maybe I could come up with a cursor-less version to walk the string, 
but I figured that it is probably faster than chunking the string bits on each iteration. 

It is already fast enough so no point in doing extra optimizations.

This can be done with bruteforce under 1 second, but it shoots within all speeds on a given range.
That is hardly a nice way of doing this. We can definitely optimize it.

Let's first take advantage that the target is on the right and down, so shots go always with **positive X speed**. 

There is two ways the target can be shot: 

- **Shoot straight** - The Y speed is negative, and it mostly gets the target from the left side.

- **Shoot up** - The Y speed is positive, and it mostly gets the target from the top side.

If I can narrow the windows of those speeds, then I have a smarter way to check speeds.

## Calculate Y speeds

We can calculate the range of Y speeds that hit the Y part of the target. 

On the example, where y=-10..-5, with bounding Box `[[20, -5], [30, -10]]`
x1=20,  x2=30, y1=-10, y2=-5

these are the Y speeds that work:

| initial y speed | partial values          |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 0               | 0,-1,-3,**-6**, **-10** |
| -1              | -1, -3, **-6**, **-10** |
| -2              | -2, **-5**, **-9**      |
| -3              | -3, **-7**              |
| -4              | -4, **-9**              |
| -5              | **-5**                  |
| -6              | **-6**                  |
| -7              | **-7**                  |
| -8              | **-8**                  |
| -9              | **-9**                  |
| -10             | **-10**                 |

For upper Y, look: 

| initial y speed | partial values                     | similar as |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| 1               | 1, 1,0,-2,**-5**, **-9**           | -2         |
| 2               | 2, 3, 3, 2, 0,-3,**-7**            | -3         |       
| 3               | 3, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 0, -4,**-9**     | -4         |
| 4               | 4, 7, 9, 10, 10, 9, 7, 4, 0, **-5** | -5         |

it will always pass again on x=0, and its speed is the negative of the initial y speed.  
so, this chart is actually already calculated with negative Ys.

Note: There may be overshots in the middle! this can happen if the height of the box can fit 
under a speed. In this example, the box height is 6, biggest jump is on vy=-4 (with a -4 to -9 jump)

so, in this case, the Ys go from -10 to  9.

## Calculate X speeds

The challenge is: 
 
. a smaller X makes it to not reach the target
. in the middle, some Xs overshoot
. after a certain X, no more. 

On the example, where y=-20..30`

| initial x speed | partial values                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0-5             | -                                   |
| 6               | 6,11,15,18,**20**,**21*             |
| 7               | 7,13,18,**22**,**25**,**27*, **28** |
| 8               | 8,15,**21**,**26**, **30**          |
| 9               | 9,17,**24**,**30**                  |
| 10              | 10,19,**27**                        |
| 11              | 11,**21**,**30**                    |
| 12              | 12,**23**                           |
| 13              | 13,**25**                           |
| 14              | 14,**27**                           |
| 15              | 15,**29**                           |
| 16-19           | -                                   |
| 20-30           | **20** - **30**                     |

So, the ranges I should see with x is [6-15] and [20-30].

to get the 30 one, use the bounding box. To get the other one, use the formula: 

    sum = (n)(n+1))/2
    2*sum = n(n+1)
    2*sum = n^2 + n
    n^2 + n - 2*sum = 0

    a=1, b=1, c=-2*sum
     
    -1+(sqrt(1+8*sum))/2

as in, `21 = 6*7/2`. or, to get it the other way around:

    (-1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 8 * 20)) / 2)
    (11.68857754044952) / 2) = 5.84

Math.ceil gives 6.

## Strategy

A good strategy is to get all the pairs [ySpeed, t] and pairs [xSpeed, t], then do the combinations.
In the example, Y speeds will be from [-10] to [9], then add them into a hash for each time. 

| time | y speeds       |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | -10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5 |
| 2    | -4,-3,-2       |
| 3    | -2,-1          |
| 4    | -1,0           |
| 5    | 0,1            |
| 6    | 1              |
| 7    | 2              |
| 9    | 3              |
| 10   | 4              |
| 12   | 5              |
| 14   | 6              |
| 15   | 7              |
| 16   | 8              |
| 20   | 9              |

By the way, the highest y speed will give the highest y position. 

That is the answer for part 1, by doing:

      distance = n(n+1)/2 = 45 for n=9

It is better to do the Y first, as they have a finite number of times.

Now, for the X speed, range from [6] to [30]: 

| time       | x speeds                       |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| 1          | 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 |
| 2          | 15,14,13,12,11                 |
| 3          | 11,10,9,8                      |
| 4          | 9,8,7                          |
| 5          | 8,7,6                          |
| 6-infinity | 7,6                            |


So, for time = 1, there is 11 * 6 = 66 combinations
       
     [20,-5] [20,-6] [20,-7] [20,-8] [20,-9]  [20,-10]

Oh, I tried to make a recursive function and structure, but it was painful to keep the reminder and 
propagate to the leftmost or rightmost number.

I ended up just breaking the "number" into string chunks. really hard puzzle, with really hard sequence 
to understand. 

Split can only be done if there is nothing to explode. The error a lot of us were doing is that we were
doing the first operation we could get, split or explode, from the beginning of the number.

That is why I have a "explodable" function, to see if I can split or not.
