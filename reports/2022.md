This is the most vanilla A*/Dijkstra algorithm implementation from all puzzles.

This is the template for all other ones. Original is still a little faster, not sure why. 

The main solution is the cleanest one, with these optimizations: 

- Avoid sets to save paths. string[] is faster. Of course, I can delete paths and be even faster, 
but some puzzles need it, and it is nice for printing.
- Check visited state while analysing neighbors. Do not add candidates if they were visited with better score.
- Still not sure, but a flat step with [number ,number, etc] may be still faster than a object.

# Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone 

> You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large network of subterranean tunnels. 
> You don't have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable sensors 
> that you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.

This is a great puzzle, as it is way easier to rotate 45 degrees and use square areas instead of diamond 
areas. also, finding the sole beacon for part 2 requires some brainstorming.

The trick here is to rotate the whole area 45 degrees so we work with squares instead of diamonds, and use
corners to find the lone beacon instead of line slopes.

To rotate 45 deg counter-clockwise, rotated coordinates of `(𝑥,𝑦)` with the matrix `[(𝑥+𝑦)/√2, (𝑦−𝑥)/√2]`

if I multiply by √2, I get (x, y) => (x + y, y - x), but then all is zoomed bigger by √2, which is fine.

I can rotate 45 degrees clockwise again with `[(𝑥-𝑦)/2 , (𝑦+𝑥)/2]`.

In part 1, the horizontal line will become a slope `(y = mx + b)` where m = -1, so
**y + x is always the same constant**. Therefore, to see if the area of a sensor intercepts the targeted y, 
it's easy to see if the sensor area corners `(x1,y1 and x2,y2)`, their sum passes the targeted constant.

In part 2, there is a lone beacon. It exists like this, in the edge of 4 areas:

         ░
        ░░░  ▒
       ░░░░░▒▒▒
       ▓░░░▒▒▒▒▒
      ▓▓▓░ █▒▒▒
     ▓▓▓▓▓███▒
      ▓▓▓█████
       ▓  ███
           █

With 45 degree rotation, it is visible like this:

        ▒▒▒
     ░░░▒▒▒
     ░░░▒▒▒
     ░░░ ███
      ▓▓▓███
      ▓▓▓███
      ▓▓▓

these can be either corner points, or interception points. They will surround the beacon,
as in (50,70), (52,70), (52,72), (50,72) surround the beacon at (51,71).

When I find that point, all I need to do is to convert back to original coordinates.

This solution, of course, assumes the beacon is surrounded by sensors. It does not work if the
beacon is in either the leftmost or rightmost parts of the considered area

The fastest way is to compute those sensor squares, augment by 1, and check if any
of the corners and/or intersects between augmented spares are not included in any of the original squares

The hard part is that there is a looooong tail of non-optimal solutions, one needs a good way of 
pruning leafs that will never produce a good result.

Where to prune? well, either the best strategy is to:

- go straight to the valve with best flow, lose some time but catch up later
- go straight to the closest valve, even if flow is not great, as early flow pays off
- something in the middle

It kind of depends on how the map is made. Here is the table of the amount of cost (JUST walking, NO cost for opening)

The little spot that was in one of the faces, and forced me to slice it in pieces to find it, was nasty. 

So, I could not just rely on corners as safe points from outside and go from there, I had to use all surface points.

I guess there would be an easier way to get the obsidien surface, by taking all points from the bounding cube and go 
straight, as in: 

    +-----------+
    |>>>>XXX<<<<|            
    |>>>XXXXXX<<|
    |>>XXXXX<<<<|
    |>>>XXXX<<<<|
    +-----------+

but it would fail on weird shapes like: 

    +-----------+
    |>>>XXXX<<<<|            
    |>>>XX XXX<<|
    |>>>>>>XX<<<|
    |>>>XXXXX<<<|

This puzzle is the hardest, because it will branch so much, there is the need to prune it properly and use a good heuristic.

The first part is straightforward, as the goal is to make a **geode robot** as fast as possible, and that can 
be achieved by looking at the ratio of ore, obsidian and clay it needs. 

Note that just adding an object to group resources and robots, makes the code 2x slower.

We need to have our own order index, because the numbers are not unique. 

So, when we swap the numbers, we also swap the index. Also, it is important to know if we 
will add first then remove, or remove first thwn add, so we preserve the index order of the array.

It is really tricky, maybe the solution is not the most efficient one, but this puzzle is hard in the sense 
that we can easily get lost with indexes.

For the first part, follow the operation list, execute until you reach the end state.

For the second part, we can split the root operation into two monkeys that should shout the same result.

One of them is tied to human. The other one is not. So, we solve the one who is not tied by reversing the 
operations and come out with a result, then use that result to get the human one. 

Maybe the code is a little unnecessarily big, but the reasoning is there and it is fast, no bruteforce.

The difficulty comes with the cube shape, that is different from test to prod. 

With test, cube is shaped as:

        +-+
        |1|
    +-+-+-+
    |2|3|4|
    +-+-+-+
        |5|6|
        +-+-+

In prod, it is shaped as: 

      +-+-+
      |2|1|
      +-+-+
      |3|
    +-+-+
    |5|4|
    +-+-+
    |6|
    +-+

It requires a "conversion" map to switch from face edges, keeping the right direction and position.

Code has a cumbersome way of jumping edges, but the logic is simple, just a way of keeping the `[row, column]`
coordinates after going outside the cube.

# Day 23: Unstable Diffusion 

> You enter a large crater of gray dirt where the grove is supposed to be. 
> All around you, plants you imagine were expected to be full of fruit are instead withered and broken. 
> A large group of Elves has formed in the middle of the grove.

Did some improvements, still have both parts needing 4 seconds on a bruteforce approach.

Not sure where to optimize more.

# Day 24: Blizzard Basin

> With everything replanted for next year (and with elephants and monkeys to tend the grove), 
> you and the Elves leave for the extraction point.
> Partway up the mountain that shields the grove is a flat, open area that serves as the extraction point. 
> It's a bit of a climb, but nothing the expedition can't handle.

The test "world" is 4 rows and 6 columns, and the prod is 25 rows by 120 columns. 
That means that the world repeats itself at leastCommonMultiple(4,6) = 12 on test world, 
leastCommonMultiple(25,120) = 600 for prod world

Let's create these snapshots and store it in memory.

The nicest version is a bad approach (my first approach), takes 25 seconds to finish, but it 
keeps the blizzard values and paths, so it is good suited for a ui visual. 

The current version is much faster, by using maps to keep track of allowed paths, and by 
using a breadth-first approach that resets 2 times for part 2. Fast enough. 

Difficulty: Very hard.

# Day 25: Full of Hot Air

> As the expedition finally reaches the extraction point, several large hot air balloons drift down to meet you. 
> Crews quickly start unloading the equipment the balloons brought: many hot air balloon kits, some fuel tanks, 
> and a fuel heating machine.

It was a little hard to get the encoder and decoder, but the examples helped.
