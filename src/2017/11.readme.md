We will use the x/y coordinates as normal charts do, x getting positive going right, y getting positive going up. 

If I am going to represent the center of these hexagonals in x/y axis, then the hexagon can have a height of 2,
width of 3. It becomes: 

                 _____         _____         _____
                /     \       /     \       /     \
          _____/ 1.5,5 \_____/ 4.5,5 \_____/ 7.5,5 \_____
         /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
        /  0,4  \_____/  3,4  \_____/  6,4  \_____/  9,4  \
        \       /     \       /     \       /     \       /
         \_____/ 1.5,3 \_____/ 4.5,3 \_____/ 7.5,3 \_____/
         /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
        /  0,2  \_____/  3,2  \_____/  6,2  \_____/  9,2  \
        \       /     \       /     \       /     \       /
         \_____/ 1.5,1 \_____/ 4.5,1 \_____/ 7.5,1 \_____/
         /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
        /  0,0  \_____/  3,0  \_____/  6,0  \_____/  9,0  \
        \       /     \       /     \       /     \       /

To go from `[7.5,5]` to `[0,0]`, it takes 5 steps. Easily tracked with the Y value. 
Now, note that to go from `[7.5,5]` to `[0,4]`, it also takes the same 5 steps.

one can do, to calculate distances quickly, is to: 
- check which quadrant we are (x/y positive or not)
- for each quadrant, walk in [1,5, 1] bits until hitting an axis (x or y)
- if it hits y axis, the remainer steps are just y values / 2.
- if it hits x axis, the remainer steps are y values until it hits, plus remainer divided by 1.5.

Example 1: hexagon at `12,4`. Quadrant NE. Bits of  [-1,5, -1].

On axis X, 12 will go to 0 in 6 bits (`Math.abs(12 / -1,5)`). 
On axis Y, 4 will go to 0 in 4 bits (`Math.abs(4 / -1)`)

It hits the X axis first with 4 moves which brings us to [6,0]. 
Then, since X still has to go, it is 6 / 1.5 = 4 more moves, for a total of 8 moves.

Example 2: hexagon at `3,6`. Quadrant NE. Bits of  [-1,5, -1].

On axis X, 3 will go to 0 in 2 bits (`Math.abs(3 / -1,5)`).
On axis Y, 6 will go to 0 in 6 bits (`Math.abs(6 / -1)`)

It hits the Y axis first with 2 moves which brings us to [0,4]
Then, since Y still has to go, it is 4 / 2 = 2 more moves, for a total of 4 moves.




Difficulty: Easy.
