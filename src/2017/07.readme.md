Hard to understand the instructions, not a nice puzzle to convert to code.

The root name is the only one who has a value of 1, as I am adding -1 for having parent,
// +1 for having children. I am doing like this because I don't control when a node is mentioned first,
// as a node or as a children
//console.log(names)
