# Day 3: Spiral Memory

> You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.
> Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and 
> then counting up while spiraling outward.

Tried to be smart and avoid doing a spiral for part 1, but part2 "forces" me to do a spiral anyway...

Difficulty: Very easy.
