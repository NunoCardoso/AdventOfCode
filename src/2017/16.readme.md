# Day 16: Permutation Promenade 

> You come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to be dancing.
> There are sixteen programs in total, named a through p. They start by standing in a line:
> a stands in position 0, b stands in position 1, and so on until p, which stands in position 15.

This is a typical have-to-find-a-delta so I can skip 10000000 iterations.

What we tried to do with puzzle 15, but couldn't find a pattern. 

So, the idea is that the program generators will end up in a repeated loop. With that, we can 
skip right to the end, so we do not have to repeat generations. 

So, if we see the same pattern at position 50 and then at position 150, that means that 
at position 250, 350, etc we will get the same values. In other words, the delta is 100, and the 
constant is 50. This ay, when we need to know the value at any number, let's say 499990, then it's about 
knowing what is the closest number without exceeding it. 

In this case:

     50 + 100 * x < 499990
     x < (500000 - 50) / 100
     x < 4999,4

So, using 50 + 100 * 4999 gives 499950, and we know that the values generated on 
iteration 499990 is the same as iteration 50, so for iteration 499990, just add 40 more, so it is 50 + 40.
We can use the value found at iteration 90 to get the value at iteration 499990.
