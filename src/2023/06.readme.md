# Day 6: Wait For It 

> The ferry quickly brings you across Island Island. After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally 
> a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island 
> where the ferry has docked.

Started with a bruteforce approach, changed to a quadratic function because part2.

Don't you 

- distance = speed * time, or (timeButtonPressed)(maxTime - timeButtonPressed)

in the example where distance = 9, maxTime = 7

    9 = (x)(7-x)
    x*x - 7x + 9 = 0
    x = (7 +- sqrt(49 - 4*1*9)) / 2*1 
    x = (7 +- 3.6)/2 
    x = 5.3 and 1.7

so, timeButtonPressed values 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the ones that make distance > 9

Difficulty: Easy.
