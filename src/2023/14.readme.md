# Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish

This is the kind of puzzle where we have a repetition, so we need to find the delta so we can extrapolate
to any iteration value. 

In the test example, I get cacheHit at `[ 9, [ 2, 69 ] ]`, meaning that I did 3 cycles (iteration 0-2), 
and then there was a repeat on 7 cycles (iteration 3-9)

To know the repeated cycle index that matches the (1000000000 - 1) cycle,
subtract 2 (first repeat cycle index) => 999999997, then mod it to the delta (999999997 % 7 = 3)
I need the score of the 3rd repeat cycle, so, first repeat cycle index (2) + 3 = cycle 5 from cache.

scores are already computed in the cache, so all I have to do is to get it out.
