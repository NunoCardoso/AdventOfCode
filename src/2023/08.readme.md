# Day 8: Haunted Wasteland

Bruteforce may work on part 1, but not at part 2.

The trick is to look at the data, and see that each start point has its own ending point. 
It's like independent paths, that take X number of steps. 

In order to have X steps all finish on the same time, we need to find the least common multiple 
of all the steps. That will bypass bruteforce.

Difficulty: Medium.
