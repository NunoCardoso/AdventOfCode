# Day 10: Pipe Maze

> You use the hang glider to ride the hot air from Desert Island all the way up to the floating metal island. 
> This island is surprisingly cold and there definitely aren't any thermals to glide on, so you leave your 
> hang glider behind.

For part 1, maybe breadth-first was not really needed, as there are only 2 initial paths and
they do not branch out, but it was quicker to implement. 

For part 2, it is much easier when we use the approach that, for some pipes, we switch between 
being in and out of the maze.
