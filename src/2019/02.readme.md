# Day 2: Program Alarm

> On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a "1202 program alarm". 
> On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--"
> The ship computer bursts into flames.

I guess there is no way to not use bruteforce. 

Difficulty: Very easy.
