# Day 6: Universal Orbit Map

> You've landed at the Universal Orbit Map facility on Mercury. 
> Because navigation in space often involves transferring between orbits, 
> the orbit maps here are useful for finding efficient routes between, 
> for example, you and Santa. You download a map of the local orbits.

Difficulty: Very easy.
