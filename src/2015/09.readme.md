> Every year, Santa manages to deliver all of his presents in a single night.
> This year, however, he has some new locations to visit; his elves have provided him 
> the distances between every pair of locations.

This is a city path travelling problem, finding the shortest / longest routes.

With this amount of cities, it is manageable to visit all permutations. Maybe for more cities, 
some sort of optimization / path finding could work faster.
