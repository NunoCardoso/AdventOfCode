# Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much

> The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this time. 
> To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. 
> You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.

The classic container puzzle.

I like the custom combination function, so I can collect the data for answers while doing all the 
permutations.

Note how I need to ID the jars with same capacity, so they can be identified differently, as they count
differently on the combinations.
