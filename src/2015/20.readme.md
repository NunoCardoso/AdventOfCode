# Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses

> To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents by hand, door-to-door. 
> He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

The bruteforce method does it in 1.7s. It is not a perfect bruteforce, as it iterates houses 
and then calculates the presents.

A much better option is to fill out the house space and iterate each elf. This way we do not have 
to find divisors repeatedly, just use each elf distance and iterate. 

Then, we can just find the first house that overshoots the threashold. The top house limit is set to the 
threshold.

This is known as the [highly abundant numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_abundant_number), and they 
are really hard to work with it. There is not really formulas to help us to predict / estimate something
so we can jump / optimize, so we are sticking with above approach that is brute-force-ish
