> Santa's previous password expired, and he needs help choosing a new one.

Let's keep generating passwords until it matches the criteria, not much optimization can be done here,
as the generation always depends on the previous step, unless we make some convoluted pattern-prediction 
algorithm, only to bypass brute-force.

Note that using 

    !!password.match(/(abc|bcd|cde|def|efg|fgh|ghi|hij|ijk|jkl|lkm|kmn|mno|nop|opq|pqr|qrs|rst|stu|tuv|uvw|vwx|wxy|xyz)/)

is slower than iterating the password characters and detecting the number sequence. 

Difficulty: Very easy
