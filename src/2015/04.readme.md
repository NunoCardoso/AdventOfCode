# Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

> Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

Nothing I can do to make it faster, I have to generate MD5 hashes in succession 
until they meet the puzzle criteria.

All puzzles tagged as MD5 will not meet the less-than-1-second criteria.

Difficulty: Very easy.
