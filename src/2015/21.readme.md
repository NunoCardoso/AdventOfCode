# Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX

> Little Henry Case got a new video game for Christmas.
> It's an RPG, and he's stuck on a boss. He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop. 
> He hands you the controller.

Really fun puzzle to implement. A little hard to get the day sequence right, 
but surprisingly quick to get optimal solution. 

Another note, see that I added None as entries, so we can have a seamless way of checking if 
a setup with partial gear solves the puzzle. 

As there is not many combinations, a brute force approach is OK, runs really quick.
