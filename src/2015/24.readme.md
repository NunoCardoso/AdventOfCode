# Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

> It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's deliveries.
> However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics,
> and nobody gets presents this year.

The problem with this puzzle, is that a generic solution can be done, but it will take 
several seconds. So, in order to run under 1s, we need to fit to the problem here. 

First optimization is to iterate from the first number of packages that can match or exceed the 
targeted weight. It shaves some unnecessary combinations from lengths that would never produce 
anything useful 

        let minPackages = 0, sum = 0
        while (sum < targetWeight) sum += packages[minPackages++]

The optimization here is that we do not recursively try to check if the other compartments can fit 
packages with targeted weight. For 3 compartments, finding one is enough, as the remaining ones can fit in halves.
For 4 compartments, one should check if the remaining packages fit in 3 compartments. 

Well, I skipped this step as it looks like finding the minimal quantum entanglement for one compartment 
is enough. Still, this runs at > 6 seconds, which no clue on how I can speed up the combination process. 

Difficulty: Very Hard
