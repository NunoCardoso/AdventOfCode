# Day 4: Passport Processing

> You arrive at the airport only to realize that you grabbed your North Pole Credentials instead of your passport. 
> While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and 
> therefore aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.

I had to give an extra newline to input so it parses the last passaport. 

Not that complicated if you know regex. 

Difficulty: Very easy.
