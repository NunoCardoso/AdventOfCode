Part 2 was a little intimidating, but nice that the text gave a warning that 
the amount of combinations might grow very big, to deter from bruteforce approaches.

So, let's think.

From the instructions, I see that the gaps are only 1 or 3. That helps a lot, so I do not have 
to worry about gaps of 2 that can "jump". 

So, the approach is to get all consecutive numbers (gap of 1), and then do the combination above. 
if there is a gap of 3, jump, continue (since all combinations will HAVE to do the 3 gap jump, so no 
alternatives to add).

So, when I have:

        [ 0, 1 ],
        [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ],
        [ 10, 11, 12 ],
        [ 15, 16 ],
        [ 19 ],
        [ 22 ]

it's 8, so 4 ([ 4, 5, 6, 7 ], or 2^(4 - 2)) * 2 ([ [ 10, 11, 12 ],], or 2^(3-2))

When I have: 

        [
        [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
        [ 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ],
        [ 14 ],
        [ 17, 18, 19, 20 ],
        [ 23, 24, 25 ],
        [ 28 ],
        [ 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 ],
        [ 38, 39 ],
        [ 42 ],
        [ 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 ],
        [ 52 ]
        ]

right answer is  7 * 7 * 4 * 2 * 7 * 7  = 19208

because for size 5, you can't count them all, there needs to be a gap. it's 2^4 (8) - 2^0 (1)

for size 6, you get `2^5 (16) - 2^1 (2) - 2^0 (1) = 13`

 as in: [0,1,2,3,4,5] => 

     0,1,2,3,4,5, 
     0,2,3,4,5  0,1,3,4,5   0,1,2,4,5  0,1,2,3,5
     0,3,4,5   0,2,4,5  0,2,3,5  0,1,4,5  0,1,3,5  0,1,2,5
     0,2,5  0,3,5

for size 7, you get `2^6 (32) - 2^2(4) - 2^1 (2) - 2^0 (1) = 32 - 7 = 25`

 as in: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] =>

     0,1,2,3,4,5,6
     0,2,3,4,5,6  0,1,3,4,5,6   0,1,2,4,5,6  0,1,2,3,5,6    0,1,2,3,4,6
     0,3,4,5,6  0,2,4,5,6   0,2,3,5,6  0,2,3,4,6  0,1,4,5,6  0,1,3,5,6   0,1,3,4,6
     0,1,2,5,6  0,1,2,4,6  0,1,2,3,6
     0,1,3,6  0,1,4,6  0,2,3,6  0,2,4,6  0,2,5,6  0,3,4,6  0,3,5,6
     0,3,6 

There is 24, so the math for `2^2(4) - 2^1 (2) - 2^0 (1)` is wrong, but luckily, the
input does not have more than 5 consecutive numbers, so I can just use the cases for 4 and 5.

Hard, as I had to do this breakdown.
