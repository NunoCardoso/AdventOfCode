# Day 13: Shuttle Search

> Your ferry can make it safely to a nearby port, but it won't get much further. When you call to book another ship, 
> you discover that no ships embark from that port to your vacation island. 
> You'll need to get from the port to the nearest airport.

> Fortunately, a shuttle bus service is available to bring you from the sea port to the airport! 
> Each bus has an ID number that also indicates how often the bus leaves for the airport.


For the example 7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19 should be 1068781

so, the idea is: 
- Take the 7. i = 0.
- Iterate i in 7 steps until you get a common number (77) with k=6, i = 77, step=7, rem=0

       i = 13*k - 1  
       ((i - 0) mod 7 == 0 

- iterate i in lcm(7*13) steps, until you get a common number (350) with k=5, i=350, 

      i = (59*k - 4)
      i % (7*13) === 77 (i=5, 350)

and so on. 

It was a little hard to get into the flow, where the steps need to be increasing, but I got there.
