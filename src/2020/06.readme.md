Again, adding a double neline in the end to help parsing. 

I like these puzzles, where part 2 makes us refactor the previous code. 

The idea for part 2 is: on first line, populate with all answers from person 1.
For next linesm 

Still, something that I can solve while parsing input is nice.

Difficulty: Easy.
