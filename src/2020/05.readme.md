# Day 5: Binary Boarding

> You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding pass! 
> You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood 
> of people that suddenly made it through passport control.

This puzzle was begging to do some binary math here. 

As in, FBFBBFFRLR is row 44 and column 5.

F is 0. B is 1. FBFBBFF is 0101100, or 44. 
R is 1. L is 0. RLR is 101, or 5.

For the second part I had to store all info on an object, so I can see the available seat. 

Difficulty: Easy.
