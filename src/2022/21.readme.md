# Day 21: Monkey Math

For the first part, follow the operation list, execute until you reach the end state.

For the second part, we can split the root operation into two monkeys that should shout the same result.

One of them is tied to human. The other one is not. So, we solve the one who is not tied by reversing the 
operations and come out with a result, then use that result to get the human one. 

Maybe the code is a little unnecessarily big, but the reasoning is there and it is fast, no bruteforce.
