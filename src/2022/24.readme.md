# Day 24: Blizzard Basin

> With everything replanted for next year (and with elephants and monkeys to tend the grove), 
> you and the Elves leave for the extraction point.
> Partway up the mountain that shields the grove is a flat, open area that serves as the extraction point. 
> It's a bit of a climb, but nothing the expedition can't handle.

The test "world" is 4 rows and 6 columns, and the prod is 25 rows by 120 columns. 
That means that the world repeats itself at leastCommonMultiple(4,6) = 12 on test world, 
leastCommonMultiple(25,120) = 600 for prod world

Let's create these snapshots and store it in memory.

The nicest version is a bad approach (my first approach), takes 25 seconds to finish, but it 
keeps the blizzard values and paths, so it is good suited for a ui visual. 

The current version is much faster, by using maps to keep track of allowed paths, and by 
using a breadth-first approach that resets 2 times for part 2. Fast enough. 

Difficulty: Very hard.
