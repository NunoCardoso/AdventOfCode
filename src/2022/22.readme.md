# Day 22: Monkey map 

> The monkeys take you on a surprisingly easy trail through the jungle. They're even going in roughly the right 
> direction according to your handheld device's Grove Positioning System.
> As you walk, the monkeys explain that the grove is protected by a force field. 
> To pass through the force field, you have to enter a password; doing so involves tracing a specific path

The difficulty comes with the cube shape, that is different from test to prod. 

With test, cube is shaped as:

        +-+
        |1|
    +-+-+-+
    |2|3|4|
    +-+-+-+
        |5|6|
        +-+-+

In prod, it is shaped as: 

      +-+-+
      |2|1|
      +-+-+
      |3|
    +-+-+
    |5|4|
    +-+-+
    |6|
    +-+

It requires a "conversion" map to switch from face edges, keeping the right direction and position.

    [1, W, <] => {2, E, <}; [1, S, v] => {3, E, <}; [1, E, >] => {4, E, <}; [1, N, ^] => {6, S, ^}
    [2, W, <] => {5, W, >}; [2, S, v] => {3, N, <}; [2, E, >] => {1, W, >}; [2, N, ^] => {6, W, >}
    [3, W, <] => {5, N, v}; [3, S, v] => {4, N, v}; [3, E, >] => {1, S, ^}; [3, N, ^] => {2, S, ^}
    [4, W, <] => {5, E, <}; [4, S, v] => {6, E, <}; [4, E, >] => {1, E, <}; [4, N, ^] => {3, S, ^}
    [5, W, <] => {2, W, >}; [5, S, v] => {6, N, v}; [5, E, >] => {4, W, >}; [5, N, ^] => {3, W, >}
    [6, W, <] => {2, N, v}; [6, S, v] => {?, ?, ?}; [6, E, >] => {4, S, ^}; [6, N, ^] => {5, S, ^}

Code has a cumbersome way of jumping edges, but the logic is simple, just a way of keeping the `[row, column]`
coordinates after going outside the cube.

Difficulty: Very hard.
