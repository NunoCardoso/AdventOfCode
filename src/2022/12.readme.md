This is the most vanilla A*/Dijkstra algorithm implementation from all puzzles.

This is the template for all other ones. Original is still a little faster, not sure why. 

The main solution is the cleanest one, with these optimizations: 

- Avoid sets to save paths. string[] is faster. Of course, I can delete paths and be even faster, 
but some puzzles need it, and it is nice for printing.
- Check visited state while analysing neighbors. Do not add candidates if they were visited with better score.
- Still not sure, but a flat step with [number ,number, etc] may be still faster than a object.
