# Day 19: Not Enough Minerals

> Your scans show that the lava did indeed form obsidian!
> The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. 
> As you do, you notice a collection of geodes around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some 
> geode-cracking robots and break them open?

This puzzle is the hardest, because it will branch so much, there is the need to prune it properly and use a good heuristic.

The first part is straightforward, as the goal is to make a **geode robot** as fast as possible, and that can 
be achieved by looking at the ratio of ore, obsidian and clay it needs. 

Note that just adding an object to group resources and robots, makes the code 2x slower.

Difficulty: Very Hard.
