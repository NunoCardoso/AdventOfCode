# Day 13: Distress Signal

> You climb the hill and again try contacting the Elves. However, you instead receive a signal you weren't expecting:
> a distress signal.
> Your handheld device must still not be working properly; the packets from the distress signal got decoded out of order. 
> You'll need to re-order the list of received packets (your puzzle input) to decode the message.

Somehow I managed to not mess up the recursion, which is quite interesting. 

Difficulty: Easy.
