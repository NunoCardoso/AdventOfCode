We need to have our own order index, because the numbers are not unique. 

So, when we swap the numbers, we also swap the index. Also, it is important to know if we 
will add first then remove, or remove first thwn add, so we preserve the index order of the array.

It is really tricky, maybe the solution is not the most efficient one, but this puzzle is hard in the sense 
that we can easily get lost with indexes.
