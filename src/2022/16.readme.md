# Day 16: Proboscidea Volcanium

The approach is that the human (and the elephant) are always ready to open valves until they are all open.

So, all steps are about adding tasks to both, but NOT in a way that one of them has more work. 

If they are both waiting in time X, giving valve 1 to human and valve 2 to elephant is DIFFERENT
from giving valve 2 to human and valve 1 to elephant, as they are in different places and moving cost is different.
