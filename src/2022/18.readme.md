# Day 18: Boiling Boulders

The little spot that was in one of the faces, and forced me to slice it in pieces to find it, was nasty. 

So, I could not just rely on corners as safe points from outside and go from there, I had to use all surface points.

I guess there would be an easier way to get the obsidien surface, by taking all points from the bounding cube and go 
straight, as in: 

    +-----------+
    |>>>>XXX<<<<|            
    |>>>XXXXXX<<|
    |>>XXXXX<<<<|
    |>>>XXXX<<<<|
    +-----------+

but it would fail on weird shapes like: 

    +-----------+
    |>>>XXXX<<<<|            
    |>>>XX XXX<<|
    |>>>>>>XX<<<|
    |>>>XXXXX<<<|
    +-----------+

So I went for a path finding solution. Not that fast, but 200ms is fine for now.
