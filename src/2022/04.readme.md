# Day 4: Camp Cleanup 

> One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. 
> Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

Functional puzzle, compacted the code to very hard to do the overlap logic and summing answers while parsing input.

Difficulty: Very easy.
