# Day 5: Alchemical Reduction

To optimize: tried splicing lists, but that is expensive. 

Regex also does not speed up things (see regex solution).

Substrings look better, but cutting them and joining them, specially one this long, is also slow (0,8s) 

What is fast is to build up a new string/array, by walking the original polymer. 

Push and pop are way easier operations than splicing middle of arrays.

Difficulty: Easy.
