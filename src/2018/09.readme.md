Brute force takes literally hours on part2, because splicing huge lists is very expensive.

The logical here is to use linked lists. My implementation gives 3 seconds, when using Map.

When using generic records, and cutting all unnecessary stuff (internal size to check if we can
remove or move, elements can be keys as they are unique, etc), This implementation goes around under 1 second.

This was a brilliant example on how I can convert minutes of processing to under 1 second!

Difficulty: Very Hard.
