# Day 1: Sonar Sweep

> As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. 
> On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor 
> depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.

Parse numeric input and doing counts. I could try to avoid lists by saving the last 3 values, but I 
left the function with generic amount of past values.

Difficulty: Very easy.
