# Day 15: Chiton

First approach (original) takes 2.7 seconds

I manage to shave time by avoiding splices (fastest).

I have a version with a queue linked list (linkedlist), so I can insert new elements in sorted way and avoid 
the need to run sort on each iteration.

It works great on puzzle 2022/12, but it still is not working here. More thinking needs to be done.
