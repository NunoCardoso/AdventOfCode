# Day 18: Snailfish

Oh, I tried to make a recursive function and structure, but it was painful to keep the reminder and 
propagate to the leftmost or rightmost number.

I ended up just breaking the "number" into string chunks. really hard puzzle, with really hard sequence 
to understand. 

Split can only be done if there is nothing to explode. The error a lot of us were doing is that we were
doing the first operation we could get, split or explode, from the beginning of the number.

That is why I have a "explodable" function, to see if I can split or not. 

Difficulty: Very hard.
