This can be done with bruteforce under 1 second, but it shoots within all speeds on a given range.
That is hardly a nice way of doing this. We can definitely optimize it.

Let's first take advantage that the target is on the right and down, so shots go always with **positive X speed**. 

There is two ways the target can be shot: 

- **Shoot straight** - The Y speed is negative, and it mostly gets the target from the left side.

- **Shoot up** - The Y speed is positive, and it mostly gets the target from the top side.

If I can narrow the windows of those speeds, then I have a smarter way to check speeds.

## Calculate Y speeds

We can calculate the range of Y speeds that hit the Y part of the target. 

On the example, where y=-10..-5, with bounding Box `[[20, -5], [30, -10]]`
x1=20,  x2=30, y1=-10, y2=-5

these are the Y speeds that work:

| initial y speed | partial values          |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 0               | 0,-1,-3,**-6**, **-10** |
| -1              | -1, -3, **-6**, **-10** |
| -2              | -2, **-5**, **-9**      |
| -3              | -3, **-7**              |
| -4              | -4, **-9**              |
| -5              | **-5**                  |
| -6              | **-6**                  |
| -7              | **-7**                  |
| -8              | **-8**                  |
| -9              | **-9**                  |
| -10             | **-10**                 |

For upper Y, look: 

| initial y speed | partial values                     | similar as |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| 1               | 1, 1,0,-2,**-5**, **-9**           | -2         |
| 2               | 2, 3, 3, 2, 0,-3,**-7**            | -3         |       
| 3               | 3, 5, 6, 6, 5, 3, 0, -4,**-9**     | -4         |
| 4               | 4, 7, 9, 10, 10, 9, 7, 4, 0, **-5** | -5         |

it will always pass again on x=0, and its speed is the negative of the initial y speed.  
so, this chart is actually already calculated with negative Ys.

Note: There may be overshots in the middle! this can happen if the height of the box can fit 
under a speed. In this example, the box height is 6, biggest jump is on vy=-4 (with a -4 to -9 jump)

so, in this case, the Ys go from -10 to  9.

## Calculate X speeds

The challenge is: 
 
. a smaller X makes it to not reach the target
. in the middle, some Xs overshoot
. after a certain X, no more. 

On the example, where y=-20..30`

| initial x speed | partial values                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0-5             | -                                   |
| 6               | 6,11,15,18,**20**,**21*             |
| 7               | 7,13,18,**22**,**25**,**27*, **28** |
| 8               | 8,15,**21**,**26**, **30**          |
| 9               | 9,17,**24**,**30**                  |
| 10              | 10,19,**27**                        |
| 11              | 11,**21**,**30**                    |
| 12              | 12,**23**                           |
| 13              | 13,**25**                           |
| 14              | 14,**27**                           |
| 15              | 15,**29**                           |
| 16-19           | -                                   |
| 20-30           | **20** - **30**                     |

So, the ranges I should see with x is [6-15] and [20-30].

to get the 30 one, use the bounding box. To get the other one, use the formula: 

    sum = (n)(n+1))/2
    2*sum = n(n+1)
    2*sum = n^2 + n
    n^2 + n - 2*sum = 0

    a=1, b=1, c=-2*sum
     
    -1+(sqrt(1+8*sum))/2

as in, `21 = 6*7/2`. or, to get it the other way around:

    (-1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 8 * 20)) / 2)
    (11.68857754044952) / 2) = 5.84

Math.ceil gives 6.

## Strategy

A good strategy is to get all the pairs [ySpeed, t] and pairs [xSpeed, t], then do the combinations.
In the example, Y speeds will be from [-10] to [9], then add them into a hash for each time. 

| time | y speeds       |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | -10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5 |
| 2    | -4,-3,-2       |
| 3    | -2,-1          |
| 4    | -1,0           |
| 5    | 0,1            |
| 6    | 1              |
| 7    | 2              |
| 9    | 3              |
| 10   | 4              |
| 12   | 5              |
| 14   | 6              |
| 15   | 7              |
| 16   | 8              |
| 20   | 9              |

By the way, the highest y speed will give the highest y position. 

That is the answer for part 1, by doing:

      distance = n(n+1)/2 = 45 for n=9

It is better to do the Y first, as they have a finite number of times.

Now, for the X speed, range from [6] to [30]: 

| time       | x speeds                       |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| 1          | 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 |
| 2          | 15,14,13,12,11                 |
| 3          | 11,10,9,8                      |
| 4          | 9,8,7                          |
| 5          | 8,7,6                          |
| 6-infinity | 7,6                            |


So, for time = 1, there is 11 * 6 = 66 combinations
       
     [20,-5] [20,-6] [20,-7] [20,-8] [20,-9]  [20,-10]
     [21,-5] [21,-6] [21,-7] [21,-8] [21,-9]  [21,-10]
     [22,-5] [22,-6] [22,-7] [22,-8] [22,-9]  [22,-10]
     [23,-5] [23,-6] [23,-7] [23,-8] [23,-9]  [23,-10]
     [24,-5] [24,-6] [24,-7] [24,-8] [24,-9]  [24,-10]
     [25,-5] [25,-6] [25,-7] [25,-8] [25,-9]  [25,-10]
     [26,-5] [26,-6] [26,-7] [26,-8] [26,-9]  [26,-10]
     [27,-5] [27,-6] [27,-7] [27,-8] [27,-9]  [27,-10]
     [28,-5] [28,-6] [28,-7] [28,-8] [28,-9]  [28,-10]
for time = 2, there is 3 * 5 = 15 combinations (total: 81)

     [15,-2]  [15,-3]  [15,-4]   [14,-2]   [14,-3]  [14,-4]
     [13,-2]  [13,-3]  [13,-4]   [12,-2]   [12,-3]  [12,-4]
     [11,-2]  [11,-3]  [11,-4]
                       
for time = 3, 4 * 2 = 8 combinations (7 unique) (total: 88) [11,-2] was already added
 
     [11,-1]  [10,-2] [10,-1]  [9,-2]  [9,-1]  [8,-2]  [8,-1]

for time = 4, 3*2 = 6 (4 unique) (total: 92) [9,-1] and [8,-1] were already added

      [9,0]   [8,0]   [7,-1]   [7,0]

for time = 5, 3*2 = 6 (4 unique) (total: 96) [8,0],[7,0] already added
      
      [8,1] [7,1]  [6,0]  [6,1]

for time = 6, 1*2 = 2 (none unique) [7,1] [6,1] already added

for time = 7, 1*2 = 2 (2 unique) (total: 98) 

      [7,2] [6,2]

for times 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 7 * 2 = 14 (112)  

    [7,3] [6,3] [7,4] [6,4] [7,5] [6,5]
    [7,6] [6,6] [7,7] [6,7] [7,8] [6,8] [7,9] [6,9]


This gives the answer to part 2.
