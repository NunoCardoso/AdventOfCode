# Day 14: 

> The incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on your submarine. 
> The submarine has polymerization equipment that would produce suitable materials to 
> reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have 
> the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.

One can see that in progress: 

    Template:     NNCB
    After step 1: NCNBCHB
    After step 2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
    After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB
    After step 4: NBBNBNBBCCNBCNCCNBBNBBNBBBNBBNBBCBHCBHHNHCBBCBHCB

A seed of 4 sizes becomes 7 (enlarged by 4 - 1). Then, 7 becomes 13 (7 + 7 - 1). And so on.
The edges are constant. In the first seed, they are N and B, and will still be there.
So, we can have the polymer to be in a map where pairs of letters are keys. 

This of course assumes that there will be aleways a rule that will react to any pair. 
By using the map, we do not need to repeat the operations, just multiply by numbers.
