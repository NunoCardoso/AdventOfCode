# Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture

> You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! 
> These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.

I am collecting 2 data sets, one for each part, while input parsing.

Using 2 sets for each part, so I do not count the ones who hit 3 or more times.

Difficulty: Very easy.
