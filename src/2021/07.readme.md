# Day 7: The Treachery of Whale

Brute force works ok, calculating distances for each position.

Note that one great optimization done is to avoid calculating double for crabs in same positions. 
I just keep track of how many crabs are in the same position, and multiply fuel consumption accordingly with 
the number of crabs, so I only have to do one calculation.

No performance improvements using Record instead of Map. 

On part 2, the fuel consumption 'accelerates' from each step. 

So, going from position 16 to 5, it uses 66 fuel: 

| position | fuel | total |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 15       | 1   | 1     |
| 14       | 2   | 3     |
| 13       | 3   | 6     |
| 12       | 4   | 10    |
| 11       | 5   | 15    |
| 10       | 6   | 21    |
| 9        | 7   | 28    |
| 8        | 8   | 36    |
| 7        | 9   | 45    |
| 6        | 10  | 55    |
| 5        | 11  | 66    |

Or the formula: 

    (distance + ((distance - 1) * (distance - 1) + (distance - 1)) / 2)
    11 + ((10*10) + 10)/2 = 66

Difficulty: Easy.
