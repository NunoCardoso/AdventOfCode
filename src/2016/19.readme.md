# Day 11: An Elephant Named Joseph

> The Elves contact you over a highly secure emergency channel.
> Back at the North Pole, the Elves are busy misunderstanding White Elephant parties.

The approach was to brute force the first 100 iterations, study the output to see the pattern, 
come up with a formula for that, then use it to produce the puzzle solutions.

So, in part 1, the pattern is: odd numbers go up on steps +2 until it matches the number of elves, then resets to 1 again

    number of Elves: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
    winning Elf:     1 1 3 1 3 5 7 1 3 5  7  9  11 13 15 1  3

For part 2, pattern is: simple progression until it reaches elves.number/2, then it's steps +2 until it 
matches the number of elves, then resets to 1 again

    number of Elves: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
    winning Elf:     1 1 3 1 2 3 5 7 9 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  11

It was hard to come up with the damn formulas, but once I got them, puzzle is dead easy.

Difficulty: Hard.
