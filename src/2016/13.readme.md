# Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles 

> You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment 
> than the shiny atrium of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.

Note that X here is the horizontal axis, Y is the vertical axis, like HTML DOM page positions.
Simple Dijkstra, just disable the end check for part2 to keep visiting.

Note that the puzzle does not require me to keep paths in the queue, locations would do just fine, 
but I want to heep paths so I can print it on a grid if I want to do some UI for all puzzles later.

There is also a non-path fastest solution that can't tell you the winning path.

Difficulty: Easy
