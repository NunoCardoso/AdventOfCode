I have a bruteforce approach that does it in under 1 second, and a faster approach that 
does it better. I take the biggest wheel, and do jumps in time when this wheel is in position 0, and 
calculate the other wheels position. It is way faster than calculate for each second 
(although understandably that is the quickest way to come up with code for the puzzle solution).

So if the biggest disc has 19 positions, and it is at position 17 on time 0, 
Disc 19 is disc #6, so there is also 6 seconds needed to reach that disc. 

Hence, the final formula for initial time to analyse is `biggestDiscSize - initialPosition - discIndex`
As in, the first time this disc will be at position 0 is at time -4 (`19 - 17 - 6`). Well, more like 
`-4 + 19 = 15` time, but it is fine to start on a negative value, as the step is there.

Now, to calculate the other disc positions on each time.

Disc #3 has 17 positions and started at position 11. The complete times of disc 3 and 6 are:

| time | disc 3 position at time 0 | disc 3 position at time +3 | disc 6 position at time 0 | disc 6 position at time +6 |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0    | 11                        | 14                       | 17                       | 4                          |

so, at for example, at time 21, the position of disc 3 when the ball arrives there (time +3) is 1.
We get it as

    (initialPosition + time + diskIndex) % maxPosition       

So, `(11 + 21 + 3) % 17 = 1`.
