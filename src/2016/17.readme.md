# Day 17: Two Steps Forward 

> You're trying to access a secure vault protected by a 4x4 grid of small rooms connected by doors. 
> You start in the top-left room, and you can access the vault once you reach the bottom-right room.

Map changes with each step, so a blind search is a good enough approach.

Since part 2 wants the longest path, that means we will visit all paths, to the least efficient one, so 
no need for a efficient search. Just something that makes all paths analysed.

Difficulty: Easy.
