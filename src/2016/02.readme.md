# Day 2: Bathroom Security

> You arrive at Easter Bunny Headquarters under cover of darkness. 
> However, you left in such a rush that you forgot to use the bathroom! 
> Fancy office buildings like this one usually have keypad locks on their bathrooms, 
> so you search the front desk for the code.

Just following directions and see where it lands on a keyboard, simple.

Code is a little verbose but it is nice the way the different keyboards reuse the same strategy.
    
Difficulty: Very easy
