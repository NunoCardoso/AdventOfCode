The bruteforce algorithm does it in around 2 seconds.

The logical way for optimization is to not generate 400000 rows, at some point 
patterns will come up. Once a row is identical, then all is predictable.

Yet, there are no common patterns. Optimizations that worked in shaving time off are: 
- to find safe places, the pattern edges must be the same. It avoids doing pattern match and having to cut 
the row in substring to make the pattern matching.
- counting can be done while producing row. Prevents an extra step of counting safe character after row is created. 

Shaves from 2 seconds to 2/3 of a second, not bad.  

Difficulty: Very easy (the puzzle; medium for optimization)
