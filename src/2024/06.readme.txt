- first, track all positions that the guard did NOT visited on part1. doing the simulation for obstacles in part2 being placed there
is useless
- second, keep track at the DIRECTION that the guard used to visit each unique place on part1. This can be used as a way
to set the obstacle and resume the simulation at that part, so we do NOT have to calculate guard visits before stumbling into the
obstacle. Make sure it is the DIRECTION of the first VISIT, as the guard can visit that point more than once before stumbling into
the new obstacle
