> You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. 
> "Thank you for visiting the North Pole!" gleefully exclaims a nearby sign. 
> You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know 
> you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the 
> rest of the North Pole base.
