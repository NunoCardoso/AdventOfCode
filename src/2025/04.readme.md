# Day 04: Printing Department

> You ride the escalator down to the printing department. They're clearly getting ready for Christmas; 
> they have lots of large rolls of paper everywhere, and there's even a massive printer in the corner 
> (to handle the really big print jobs).

Finally up to speed, part 2 did not pose a big problem, got the fact that you can only remove toilet papers 
after you do an interation. A proper optimization would be to index where rolls of paper are, so I do not have 
to check the '.' points, but it was fast enough.

Difficulty: Very Easy
