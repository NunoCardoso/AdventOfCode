# Day 03: Lobby

> You descend a short staircase, enter the surprisingly vast lobby, and are quickly cleared by the security checkpoint. 
> When you get to the main elevators, however, you discover that each one has a red light above it: they're all offline.

Easy part 1, but part 2 made me have to redo the whole thing, as a recursive function was needed.
Medium difficulty because I had to fine tune the recursion to fit any length. Happy with the outcome. 

Difficulty: Medium
