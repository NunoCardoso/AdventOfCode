04: md5, > 2 s, nothing I can do to make it faster
22: if I let Nothing to be an action, then I get a lower value for part 2 (987) than the answer (1216)
24: 6/7 seconds, not sure if I can do it better

2016: ONGOING
05: md5, 18s, nothing I can do to make it faster
11: 18s, maybe it can be done better
14: md5, 27s, nothing I can do to make it faster

2017:
03: tree to start

2021:
18: free to start

2022: DONE
= = = = =
15: on 16 seconds. rotate -45 deg
16: over 1 min
    - errors on test part2
    - error on part 2 value (execution is fine)
22: test does not work, have to reshape cube for test
23: on 6 seconds
24: too long, but it finishes with right solution

2016/13 is the simplest searchAlgorithm implementation
